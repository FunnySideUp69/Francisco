        <h2>Boca Juniors fan ⚽</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Neuquen near the border with Chile. As an argentinian and a patagonian I was raised with icons such as Messi, Maradona, Mario Quempes or Carlos Tevez. I'm a huge fan of <strong>Boca Juniors</strong>.

        <h2>Cooking and gastronomic curiousity 🧅</h2>
        <p>
          As most of argentinians, I also have the italian citizenship. Therefore I learned the pleasure of cooking alongside my <strong>Nonno and my Nonna</strong>. My favorite dish is obviously the national <strong>Asado</strong> and my Nonna's <strong> "Milanesas"</strong>.

        <h2> Bikes 🏍 </h2>
        <p>
          When my Nonno arrived to Argentina after WW2, the only thing he took with him is his FB Mondial. I think that explaines why I'm passionate about <strong> motorbikes </strong>.
